I'm Kai-Ting (Ting) Neo, FCAS, MAAA. I am a data scientist and actuary hailing from NYC, Hong Kong and Singapore.

Analytics and data science bring out a deep rooted joy of discovery in me. I love exploring (both in the realms of reality and abstraction), and connecting patterns to find truths. Learning data science is like equipping myself with tools to satisfy my curiosity of the world - much like acquiring a map, or sending a jury-rigged contraption hurtling into the void of space.

After graduating from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania, I spent 8 years in consulting driving actuarial and operational solutions for property & casualty insurance clients. I have recently joined <link>Metis</link>, a 12-week data science bootcamp, as a fellow. I created this blog to showcase my projects, chronicle my data science journey, and share findings.

I am interested in insurance and insurtech, bridging the gap between business and technology, and creating value from data-driven insights. In my free time, I enjoy travelling, hiking, cycling, reading science fiction and fantasy, indie electronica and ros√©.

I would love to talk to you! Please don't hesitate to reach out to me at neo.kaiting@gmail.com.
