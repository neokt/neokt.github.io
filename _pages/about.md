Hi, I'm Ting Neo. I am a data scientist hailing from NYC, Hong Kong and Singapore, and I'll soon be relocating to the Bay Area! 
 
Data science and machine learning bring out a deep rooted joy of discovery in me. I get excited about building things, I love exploring (both in the realms of reality and abstraction), and I enjoy connecting patterns to shape my perspective of the world. 

After graduating from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania with a B.Sc. in Economics, I spent many years in consulting as an actuary evaluting insurance risk for property & casualty insurance clients. In 2016, I attended [Metis](http://www.thisismetis.com/), a 12-week data science bootcamp to transition into a data science career. I created this blog to showcase my projects, chronicle my data science journey, and share findings.

In my free time, I enjoy reading science fiction and fantasy, travelling, hiking, cycling, running, indie electronica and playing the piano.

I would love to talk to you! Please don't hesitate to reach out to me at <neo.kaiting@gmail.com>.
